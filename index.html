    <p>Currently employed in the health care sector with a view to transferring my extraordinary attributes to a developer role.<br/>
    Awarded an MBBS at Flinders University in 1993.<br/>
    Subsequently trained at the Sydney Eye Hospital, becoming a fellow of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists in January 2001.<br/>
    Successfully completed two fellowships in vitreoretinal surgery at Westmead Hospital, Sydney and The Western Eye Hospital, London.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>Although my ophthalmology career spans 25 years, my IT studies are more recent but abreast of current paradigms.<br/>
    Completed studies in python, linux, data analytics and data engineering.<br/>
    Continuing studies in web development, machine learning and cloud computing.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>My eclectic skills are suitable for a rolein bioinformatics, but certainly not restricted to that field.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>I excel in critical thinking, pattern detection, accurate snap decision making and problem solving, and thrive in high pressure environments to deliver precise and reproducible outcomes.<br/>
    I can work collaboratively due to my vast experience working in the operating theatre or individually due to my exceptional motivation and singular focus.<br/>
    </p>  
    <p>I am eager to leverage my accomplished analytical and problem solving abilities to a python developer role.</p><br/>
